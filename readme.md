MPH STARTER
===========

This is my starter theme. Clone the repo, update style.css and get to work. Use as much or as little as you want. Delete everything and just use the directory structure or build on top of it. It's up to you.

Why?
----

At Human Made we have [HM Base](https://github.com/humanmade/hm-base) for full WordPress projects. Well this is that for themes.

Mainly it is a base for how I would like to organise a new theme. Theme directory structure. Use of template parts. Organisation of CSS/JS & use of Grunt. Base functions.php etc. Reusable CSS components. Somewhere to store all those snippets of code I always use. etc

Everyone that does any front end stuff should probably do it.
